# ChatApp-Backend

Welcome to the **ChatApp-Backend** repository! This project is the backend component of ChatApp, a real-time chat application built using Strapi, an open-source headless CMS. The backend handles user authentication, real-time messaging via WebSocket, and data management, providing a solid foundation for the frontend component.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **Real-time Messaging**: Supports WebSocket for instant message exchange between the client and the server.
- **Content Management**: Utilizes Strapi’s powerful content management system for handling user data and chat history.
- **Custom API Endpoints**: Easily extend and customize the API to meet specific requirements.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later)
- **Strapi** (automatically set up during installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashlt224/ChatApp-Backend.git
   cd ChatApp-Backend
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and configure your environment variables. Here’s an example:

   ```bash
   HOST=0.0.0.0
   PORT=1337
   APP_KEYS=your_app_keys_here
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
   DATABASE_CLIENT=sqlite
   DATABASE_NAME=.tmp/data.db
   ```

   Adjust the configuration based on your preferred database and other settings.

2. **Database Configuration:**

   Strapi supports SQLite (default), MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. You can configure your database connection in the `.env` file.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Strapi server:**

   ```bash
   npm run develop
   ```

   This command will start the Strapi development server, and you can access the Strapi admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

2. **Access the Admin Panel:**

   Once the server is running, create your first admin user by accessing the admin panel at `http://localhost:1337/admin`.

## Usage

- **Admin Panel**: Manage users, content, and application settings via the Strapi admin panel.
- **API Endpoints**: Utilize the automatically generated RESTful API endpoints for managing user authentication and chat data.
- **WebSocket Communication**: The backend is configured to handle real-time WebSocket connections for the chat application.
